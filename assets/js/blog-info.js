    date: "4 Jun, 2020",
    data:"<p class='paratext'> We stand in solidarity with the black community in the fight for racial justice. At this incredibly difficult time, it’s never been more important to examine and challenge the biases and mindsets that lead to unequal justice, racial bias and systemic inequality. These biases start in early childhood, and parents have an important role in helping their children become anti-racist.<br/><br/>Here’s a bit of context to start. Children start to recognise different races as early as 6 months old (Kelly et al, 2005). By the time they are 2–4 years old, they can have already internalised biases based on their environment, including using race to choose playmates (Katz & Kofkin, 1997). By 5 years old, black and latinx children in research settings don’t show a preference for their own groups, while white children are more likely to be biased in favour of whiteness (Dunham et al, 2008; Kinzler, 2016; Aboud, 2008). By the age of 12, most children become set in their beliefs (Anderson & Douge, 2019).",
    data2:"<p class='paratext'>At the same time, <b>research shows that having conversations about race early can help children change their behaviour and thinking,</b> and that at this age the change can happen quickly. That makes this first decade an important window of opportunity to support children in becoming aware of racial bias and making daily equitable choices. Here’s how you can start:<br/><br/><b class='blog-context-title'>Use your child’s observations as opportunities to talk about race</b> <br/><br/> When your little one notices that someone’s skin colour, language, hair etc. is different from their own, acknowledge and celebrate the difference. You can say, “I know, isn’t it wonderful how we are all so different?” <br/> <br/> It can be tempting, especially in public spaces, to shush your little one or feel embarrassed when they make a comment about differences. However doing this can send the message that differences are a bad thing, and something we shouldn’t talk about. Try and resist this by openly acknowledging that your little one is right, and celebrating the difference they noticed.",
    data3:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Teach your little one about personal space</b><br/><br/>Children are naturally curious, and may want to touch someone’s hair or skin when they notice a difference. Teach your little one that everyone has personal space, and that they need to ask permission before they touch any part of someone’s body.<br/><br/><b class='blog-context-title'>Expose your child to diverse representation and stories</b><br/>Find books and media that expose your little one to diverse characters, cultures, and stories. Once the lockdown is lifted, seek out opportunities to meet and interact with families and children of different cultures.<br/><br/>Common Sense Media has compiled a list of Books with Characters of Color you can use as a starting point.<br/>As early as 1 year old, you can point out different skin colours and features on characters in books, and reinforce to your little one that they’re all beautiful. For 3–5 year olds, when there are minority main characters in books or movies, don’t call attention to their race. If your little one notices, acknowledge the observation, and if they keep asking questions, engage them in the conversation.<br/><br/>",
    data4:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Model and be aware of influences</b><br/><br/>Try and be conscious of how people and media around your child talk about race, including yourself. Little ones imitate what they say and hear, so try and create an environment where the conversation about race is inclusive and positive.<br/><br/><b class='blog-context-title'>Recognise and challenge biases children may have already internalised</b><br/><br/>Watch out for statements from your little one that link race or appearance with judgments about values, beauty etc. For example, your child might say, “I want to dress up like Elsa because she’s pretty, not Moana.”<br/><br/>When you hear something like this, pause, and don’t scold or shut down your child. Instead, ask open ended, non-judgmental questions to understand why your child said this. Then talk to your child about how what they said might make someone feel.</p>",
    data5:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Talk about current injustice and fairness</b><br/><br/>First of all, take care of yourself and your emotional and mental wellbeing, so that you are able to have calm conversations with your little one about what is happening. Many parents are experiencing vicarious trauma, and it’s important to take care of yourself first.<br/><br/>Also, try to read or watch news when your little one isn’t around. This is because children pick up on stress and anger in the media, and the way others talk about race. These emotions are contagious, and your little one might become more fussy and irritable as a result. They might also imitate what they’re seeing and hearing on the news.<br/><br>Do, however, talk to your little one about what is happening, and don’t shy away from their questions. As you do this, acknowledge your child’s feelings, and let them know they are safe.<br/><br/>If your little one is over 3, you can talk about racism and discrimination in terms of fairness. Explain what happened in simple terms, for example, “sometimes, people are scared of people with dark skin,” and ask your child whether they think this is fair, and why?<br/><br/>This can lead to difficult and important conversations as your little one asks why and thinks out loud. If, in the process of talking, you aren’t sure what to say, don’t be afraid to tell your little one, “I don’t know, I’m still learning too,” and do some research to help guide your conversation.<br/><br/>Being anti-racist means making , “frequent, consistent, equitable choices daily.” All of us need to become comfortable with discussing and reflecting on race to be able to make these daily choices. And helping your child become comfortable with this from the earliest age can help transform the system to be more racially just.    "

    title: "4 ways to make the most of online parent communities",
    subtitle: "Written by<b> Puja Balachander</b>, CEO at Devie",
    date: "1 Jun, 2020",

    data: "<p class='paratext'>The early years of parenthood can be lonely! 68% of new parents in a survey conducted by Action for Children reported feeling cut off from friends and family, and the majority reported feeling lonely. One thing researchers have found can help is connecting with other parents who are going through similar highs and lows to you. Also, we’ve heard from Devie parents that children help them make new friends as an adult. When parents go to a local stay and play or parent-support group, they can make new, close friendships that last!<br/><br/>But the lockdown makes this tough. Even after restrictions are lifted, it seems as though opportunities to connect in person may be few and far between. So finding ways to make these meaningful connections online is important! But too often, these communities can feel judgmental. We’ve heard from many Devie parents that they avoid using online forums and groups because it makes them feel insecure about parenting. That’s why we used our insights from research and parent chats with Devie to put together a few guidelines on interacting with other parents online.",

    data2: "<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Offer suggestions rather than ‘rules’, because there’s no one right way to parent</b><br/><br/>It can be tempting to assume that there’s a single right or effective way of helping your little one sleep, behave, eat etc., especially when it worked for you and your child! It’s great to offer techniques and strategies that worked for you as suggestions — but it’s important to remember that every family and child is different, and needs to make their own choices.<br/><br/>And we’ve seen this in action! Now that hundreds of parents have talked to Devie, it’s interesting to see how activities that work well for some families don’t work at all for others. It shows us that there’s no “one size fits all” in parenting. So we can offer suggestions and advice, but keep in mind that each family needs to adapt and find what works for them.",

    data3: "<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Listen and validate, rather than offer advice</b><br/><br/>Parenting is a tough journey, and every parent we speak to has times when they feel insecure or like a “bad parent.” When another parent reaches out for support, it’s more helpful to acknowledge and validate their feelings, than to try to offer advice to fix the problem (unless they asked for advice). This is a technique that comes from research in mental health — sometimes the most useful thing you can do is say, “I know you’re feeling terrible right now, that’s okay, and I’m here for you.”<br/><br/>We saw this on Devie too — parents get frustrated with Devie when she offers advice or a fix right away. They wanted to tell her more about what was bothering them, and being offered a solution too soon made them feel like they were being forced to find solutions to their challenges before they were ready to.",

    data4: "<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Acknowledge feelings and share your experience, because judgment doesn’t change minds</b><br/><br/>An interesting insight from the science of behaviour change is that when people feel judged about their decisions or actions, they get defensive and actually become more convinced that they are correct. This is such a powerful insight! It means that even if a decision feels ‘wrong’ to you, telling someone they are wrong almost never changes their behaviour. On the contrary, it does more to convince them they are right!<br/><br/>So if you see a decision you don’t agree with, try to place yourself in the other parent’s shoes. How might they be feeling? What might have prompted them to make these decisions for their family?<br/><br/>If you’d like to engage, add your comment as ‘another point of view,’ not as ‘the right way.’ Consider acknowledging emotions, and offering your experience without commenting on the other parent’s choices. For example, “Ooh I remember that phase was difficult for me too, when we went through it we did…”",

    data5: "<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>‘Treat others as you would like to be treated’</b><br/><br/>Now more than ever, online parent communities are a useful way to make meaningful connections, and feel less isolated. Following these guidelines as you engage can make them a more positive and supportive place for you and all the other parents online!<br/><br/>We’re building a community based on these guidelines at Devie through our private Feedback and Support Group on FB. If you’re interested in connecting with and supporting parents in an open and positive community, request to join here — https://www.facebook.com/groups/devieparentssupport/",

    date:"29 May,2020",
    data:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>The basics</b><br/><br/>In the UK, nursery schools have been closed to most children for the past seven weeks, with the exception of the children of key workers and those considered ‘vulnerable’. However, many nursery schools are set to re-open for all children from Monday, 1 June.<br/><br/>Government has advised nurseries to take necessary precautions to protect the health of children and nursery school staff, such as by having allocated drop-off times, small ‘clusters/bubbles’ of children and encouraging frequent hand washing. Government has also asked parents to choose between taking their children to nursery or arranging a minder to look after their child. Each nursery seems to be implementing slightly different safety measures, though these are some of the common ones:<br/><ul class='paratext''><li>Checking children’s temperatures and sanitising their hands when they arrive at the nursery setting</li><br/><li>Wiping down surfaces and toys frequently</li><br/><li> Reducing the number of children at nursery at one time by having some children come to nursery in the first half of the week and the other children to come to nursery in the second half of the week</li><br/><li> Encouraging the use of face masks</li></ul>",
    data2:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Common concerns</b><br/><br/>Over the last week, we’ve chatted to some parents and early years professionals to find out how they are feeling about the reopening of nursery schools. Some parents are excited while others are worried or unsure! While some parents expressed health concerns, the overwhelming response was a concern about how these measures would affect their children socially and emotionally. <br/><br/><b>Will my little one still be comforted & cuddled?</b><br/><br/> “How will my little one feel if he falls down and key workers don’t pick him up and offer him cuddles because they are keeping a distance?” asked one worried mum. This seems to be a common concern for many parents! It seems that each nursery is making its own decisions about the ways that nursery staff will interact with the kids.",
    data3:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Will little children experience more separation anxiety?</b><br/><br/>Most children have been spending far more time than usual with their parents, so many parents have expressed concerns that their children will experience high levels of separation anxiety when they go back to nursery. Others worry that having less time with their child will be really difficult for them. One mum we chatted to, sweetly exclaimed, “My little one has become so affectionate lately! We’ll be playing and he’ll just come up to me and wrap his arms around me. I’m sad that I’ll be getting less of this in my day!” When dropping your child at nursery, it can help to offer them lots of cuddles and reassurance that you will be back later.<br/><br/><b>My child is experiencing such big emotions!</b><br/><br/>One parent told us how her child has been acting in more challenging ways lately and experiencing more tantrums than usual. She realised that this behaviour was largely because her child was so afraid of the virus. She supported him to speak about his feelings, which helped him and her feel a little better. Try to let your little one know that it is okay to be feeling the way that they are about going back to nursery school — whether that be scared, happy, excited or a mix of many emotions! You can do this in a few ways, though you’ll need to adapt these suggestions to suit your child:<br/><ul <p class='paratext''><li>You can read stories together that talk about feelings (we love the book ‘A Huge Bag of Worries’) and then chat about your feelings and your child’s feelings</li><li>You could ask your child to ‘draw’ how they feel and then to talk a little bit about this</li><li>You could even make ‘feelings puppets’ with your little one by drawing different facial expressions (e.g. happy, sad, scared) on wooden spoons or paper plates and asking your child which puppet best matches how they are feeling</li></ul>",
    data4:"<p class='paratext'> <b class='blog-context-title'>Daddy, the masks are so scary!</b><br/><br/>Many parents have said that their children get frightened when they see people wearing masks. In addition to these masks being ‘scary’ for some little children, it also means that they are unable to see the facial expressions of the person wearing the mask. Not only are children usually comforted by smiles and happy faces — they learn a lot about emotions from every facial expression that they see. Also, watching the movement of mouths can help support their language development. Many early years teachers, and parents too, are worried about mask-wearing taking away an important source of learning for little ones. In saying that though, face masks can play a big and important role in reducing the spread of the virus. It seems that decisions on mask-wearing are being made on a nursery by nursery basis!<br/><br/><b>Mummy, why can’t I play with my friends?</b><br/><br/>A few parents wondered how their children would feel being in separate ‘bubbles’ from their close friends. Another related worry was that their children might not be placed with their same key workers as before. “How will my child feel around new children and a new key worker? It’s going to be so scary for him, all over again!” Though, we have been informed that many nursery schools will do their best to put children in ‘bubbles’ with their friends and original key workers!",
    data5:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Clear communication</b><br/><br/>At Devie, we believe that the best way to handle some of these common concerns is through clear and transparent communication. Not only is it important for the government to be updating guidelines for nurseries, and nurseries to communicate potential changes to parents, it’s also really important that parents try to communicate with children in clear, easy-to-understand ways. These are scary times for little children (and adults too)! Helping children to understand part of what is going on, in a way that doesn’t make them more scared, is important (though very challenging). Regardless of whether your little one is going back to nursery, or starting nursery for the first time, it can be really helpful to talk about what it will be like to help them feel prepared and excited.<br/><br/><ul class='paratext''><li>For children who have been to nursery before, try to explain how things will be a bit different this time. Also, to help them embrace going back, you could ask them who they are most excited to see and what they are most excited to do!</li><li>For children who will be starting nursery for the first time, it can be helpful to show them photos of the nursery setting and their key workers to help them feel more comfortable.</li></ul><br/><br/><p class='paratext''><b>Stay strong, you’ve got this!</b><br/><br/>Every family’s situation is different and while there are some common concerns surrounding childcare and nursery schools, concerns are usually specific to each family’s context. On that note, we hope that our parent community can try to be understanding and empathetic towards those with different viewpoints. We wish you all the best as you make the decisions surrounding childcare that are best for you and your family!</p>",

    date:"22 May,2020",
    data:"<p class='paratext'>Since the beginning of lockdown, hundreds of parents have chatted with Devie, and one thing is clear — parents are experiencing emotional highs and lows as they face challenges like juggling work and child care, home schooling, financial instability and mixed emotions about the return to nursery on June 1 (among many others!). The daily rollercoaster of emotions can be exhausting.<br/><br/>And since it’s mental health awareness month, we thought we’d offer a few suggestions that might help you to cope with the highs and lows of parenting. While the solutions below are evidence-based, they aren’t a replacement for therapeutic support. If you think you or someone you know needs more support, consider some of these resources from the NHS: https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/",
    data2:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Be grateful for the highs</b><br/><br/>Let’s start with the positives. Parenting comes with lots of positive experiences that are easy to take for granted. Maybe it’s a moment when you’re proud of the kindness your little one shows to a sibling, or a feeling of love when you get a spontaneous hug! Reflecting on and being grateful for these little moments can make you feel more positive about the whole day.<br/><br/> One way to do this is by writing down three things you’re grateful for in the morning right after your wake up and/or in the night before going to bed. <b>You can now do this with Devie!</b> We’re testing out a new feature where parents can reflect with Devie on their emotions — and you don’t even have to remember to write things down in a journal :) Try it out and tell us what you think!",
    data3:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Acknowledge and validate your negative emotions</b><br/><br/>But let’s get real, there are daily moments when parenting can be stressful and frustrating, and being on lockdown makes this even more challenging. On top of this, parents tell Devie that they often feel guilty about feeling stressed or frustrated! It’s so important for parents to start by acknowledging that their feelings are valid — it’s okay to find parenting stressful or frustrating! <br/><br/>The first step in validating your feelings, is to reflect on and name your emotion. Start by reflecting on how you’re feeling, and ask yourself some gentle questions about why you’re feeling that way — this might help you name your emotion, and acknowledge it without judgment.",
    data4:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Reflect on and reframe the negatives</b><br/><br/>Now that you’ve named your emotion, you’re ready to reflect on, and perhaps reframe it.<br/><br/>For example, if you’re feeling guilty about how you reacted to your little one’s tantrum, it might be helpful to show yourself a little compassion, think about what you want to do differently the next day, and reflect on why doing things differently might benefit you and others. Or if you’re feeling anxious about your little one’s progress with milestones like weaning or walking, it might be helpful to think further into the future, about how you’ll feel about these worries in a year, or even a few weeks. Your worries of the moment might fade a little with the perspective of your future self :)",
    data5:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>BTW- Devie can help you reflect in these ways.</b> Give the new wellbeing check-in feature on a try and tell us what you think!<br/><br/>All of this is a long winded way of saying be kind to yourself, and try and maintain a little perspective in the everyday moments. The thing we most often hear from parents (as cliche as it is) is that these early years fly by, and that maintaining a little perspective through the daily highs and lows can help you enjoy this special time with your little one ❤️",

If your toddler’s sleep routine is leaving you to face the day like a zombie, after a night of very little zzz — we have some tips that might help your little one to sleep through the whole night!",
    data2:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>BUILD A BLISSFUL BEDTIME ROUTINE</b><br/><br/>Getting your little one into a consistent bedtime routine is easier said than done, but you can make it more appealing by turning bedtimes into a loving, comforting nightly ritual with your child. Keeping bedtimes and routines consistent can help your little one to fall asleep more quickly, and can also help reduce the chance of them waking up during the night.<br/><br/>Building a gentle sleep routine can be very simple. You might start by giving your little one a bath and putting them in a fresh nappy or pyjamas. Next, try dimming the lights and then read a bedtime story or sing a little lullaby. End your special bedtime routine with a goodnight cuddle, tuck them in and watch them drift off to snooze town!",
    data3:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>REACTING TO WAKE-UPS</b><br/><br/>Even with the sweetest and snooziest bedtime routines, your little one might still wake up during the night — or decide they’re not that interested in sleeping in the first place! If this is the case, it’s important to have a strategy for how you’re going to react and to keep this consistent.<br/><br/>If your little one gets up at night or calls out because there’s something they need, like going to the toilet, then help them out. If they climb out of bed but don’t need anything, calmly put them back to bed and encourage them to go back to sleep.<br/><br/>While it’s normal to want to comfort your child by sitting in their room or snuggling into bed with them, repeating these actions will form habits — and you might find they expect the same every bedtime. None of these actions are negative — it just depends on what habits you’d be willing to keep up!",
    data4:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>SCHEDULING NAP TIME</b><br/><br/>Toddlers sleep from about 11–12 hours at night, and usually, another 1–2 hours during the day. Making sure nap time is at the same time, and lasts for the same duration every daycan help your little one settle down when it is time to go to bed at night.<br/><br/>If you can, try to create a routine that works around when your child naturally gets sleepy. This might include signs like:<ul style='margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'><li>Rubbing their eyes</li><li>Fussiness</li><li>Reduced alertness</li></ul>",
    data5:"<p class='paratext'>Once you’ve had some time to get familiar with these signs, try to plan your little one’s naps for about 15 minutes before they get sleepy. This way, they’ll have some time to get ready and settled for their nap! <br/><br/> Next, try and plan the duration of your little one’s nap too — too short, and it might be hard to fall asleep at night because they’re over-tired. Too long, and they might not be sleepy at the time they’re supposed to. This will probably take some little experimenting, but it might be useful to start with an hour.<br/><br/>Try and stick to your schedule as much as possible by putting your little one down for a nap at the same time each day, for the same amount of time. Even if there are interruptions, having this routine will help their nighttime sleep schedule get back on track — and hopefully, help them to sleep through the night!<br/><br/>Interested in more ways to help your little one sleep through the night? <b>Try out the free Devie app on iOS and Android, and tell us what you think!

    title: "Toddler Tantrums: How to handle your little one’s big feelings",
    subtitle: "Written by<b> Isobel Montgomery</b>,  Social Media Intern at Devie",
    date:"5 May,2020",
    data:"<p class='paratext'>Little ones have a lot of big feelings, and as a parent, you might sometimes get frustrated by how they express their emotions! Temper tantrums, mood swings, crying and shouting are some of the ways toddlers try to share their feelings with you — supporting your little one to calm down during these challenging times, and develop the ability to manage and express those big emotions is an incredibly important (and challenging) part of parenting a toddler!! We know this can be tough, so to help out, we’ve put together a few activities and tips to help your little one understand and express their emotions.",
    data2:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Learn the signs of when your toddler is heading to tantrum town!</b><br/><br/>Toddlers can have very rapid mood swings, from crying because they fell over to dancing in front of the television only moments later! This behaviour usually starts from around 18 months of age, and should be less common by the time your little one turns 4 and their language skills improve. In the meantime, it’s good to try and learn the key signs that show your child is getting frustrated!<br/><br/>Some warning signs of your child’s incoming temper tantrum include:<ul style='margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'><li>Raising their voice</li><li>Throwing objects</li><li>Struggling to speak clearly about what they want</li><li>Losing focus</li><li>Holding their breath</li></ul><p class='paratext''>Changes in routine, having trouble communicating what they want, or feeling like they don’t have control over the situation can be big tantrum triggers for little ones! But sometimes, the causes of your little one’s distress might be simpler to address — they could be hungry, tired or even feeling a little jealous that your attention isn’t on them! Once you know the signs, try to figure out the source of your toddler’s frustration so you can respond to them appropriately.",
    data3:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Responding to tantrums — prevent, distract and ignore</b><br><br>One of the best ways to prevent tantrums is using these early signs to give your child what they need — as long as it’s reasonable to do so. For example, if your little one is getting irritable because they are tired or hungry, try giving them something to eat or putting them to bed before their frustration gets any worse. Finding distractions can also sometimes be helpful — you might try giving them their favourite toy, or singing a song!<br><br>If your toddler ends up having a tantrum anyway, it’s important not to give in straight away. If your little one doesn’t have negative consequences for tantrums, they might start thinking it’s a good strategy to get what they want — even if it’s not very ideal for you!<br></br>First of all, try and stay as calm as you can. Your little one is taking emotional cues from you, so modeling staying calm can help calm their tantrum down faster. Next, make sure your little one is safe, but try and ignore their reactions. If you’re at home, and you think it’s safe, you might even try going into another room for a few minutes. Once your little one is slightly older, you might also try putting them into timeout and resuming your activities once they’ve calmed down. Finally after the worst has passed, try and acknowledge your little one’s feelings. You might say, “I know you feel frustrated right now, it’s okay to feel frustrated, but it’s not okay to throw things and scream.”<br></br>It’s just as important to reward your little one for their good behaviour. If you’re noticing they’re managing their feelings well, make sure to praise them and let them know they’re doing a good job! Giving them lots of attention and love when they are behaving well also helps, as many little ones get upset when they want more attention from their parents.",
    data4:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Taming the “terrible twos” — talking about emotions together</b><br/><br/>Toddlers are experiencing natural physical and emotional responses to situations, like all of us do. However, unlike older humans, they don’t know how to put their feelings into words. This can be very scary and overwhelming! To make it less overwhelming, it helps to teach your child about the language of emotions and the ways we identify and communicate how we feel.<br/><br/>One activity to help develop this language is using puppets to talk about feelings. You and your little one can make a simple puppet together — for example, a wooden spoon with a happy face drawn on one side, and a sad face on the other.<br/><br/>As you’re drawing the face, talk to your little one about how you might show that your spoon character is feeling happy and sad. Then, you can use the puppet and its emotion to talk about feelings and situations relevant to your child.",
    data5:"<p class='paratext'>For example, you could say “I can see that your puppet is really happy about eating spaghetti tonight. I can tell from the big smile on their face!”<br/><br/>Or, you could say “I can see that your puppet isn’t feeling so good about sleeping without a bottle. I can tell from his frowny face that they’re worried”.<br/><br/>Once your little one gets a hang of using the puppets, you can try using them after a tantrum to help your little one express how they were feeling.<br/><br/>Eventually, once your little one has a better grasp on how to talk about their feelings, they’ll hopefully express their frustrations and emotions verbally, rather than through tantrums.<br/><br/>Remember — tantrums are a totally normal part of being a toddler, and it’s also completely normal to find them difficult to deal with!

    date:"30 Apr, 2020",
    data:"<p class='paratext'>Dealing with separation anxiety can cause a lot of heartache for the parents of little ones. Separation anxiety is a stage where a child becomes anxious when separated from their main caregiver and can involve behaviour such as excessive crying when their caregiver leaves them, clinging to parents, nightmares and a fear of going to bed alone.",
    data2:"<p class='paratext'>While it is a completely normal part of child development, this issue can be very stressful — especially at times when you are working from home, and need space from your little one to get things done But don’t worry — you are not alone, and we have plenty of advice for helping your child get more comfortable with separation.",
    data3:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Peekaboo, I see you! Practising separations early</b><br/><br/>Separation anxiety often develops after your baby has already spent time being left alone or with their other parent and has seemingly had no issues. This may seem a bit strange, but it’s a sign that your baby has developed a strong bond with you and knows they are dependent on your care.<br/><br/>To help get your child used to being away from you, start by practicing short separations at first. Even playing basic games like peekaboo helps teach your baby that you will return after “leaving”. Once your baby or child is old enough, try talking to them about where you’re going and what you’ll do when you come back — to give them something to look forward to!<br/><br/>By starting with small periods of time and progressively leaving your child for longer and longer, you’ll help your child get more confident in their independence!",
    data4:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Avoid giving into guilt</b><br/><br/>We know it’s never a good feeling to walk away from your crying child. Many parents find themselves feeling conflicted over their child’s separation anxiety, as our first instinct is often to comfort our little one when they’re feeling stressed! However, if your little one realises that crying or other behaviours will make you stay in a room with them, they will continue their behaviours and stall on overcoming their anxiety.<br/><br/>If you struggle with feelings of guilt when leaving your child, try to remember that this behaviour won’t go on forever. With consistent behaviour and a bit of patience, your child will realise that you’ll always return after leaving — and this will help comfort them while you are gone!",
    data5:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Be positive</b><br/><br/>One of the best ways we can encourage our little ones is by turning challenging moments into a positive experience! Often, separation anxiety can be frustrating for parents — and while that is understandable, your little one will need positive reassurance to help them learn not to be so scared! Try to stay positive when saying goodbye to your child and leave them with something comforting to play with, like a favourite toy. Also, be sure to give your child lots of attention when they are being brave about being away from you.<br/><br/> Remember — your little one is reacting so strongly because of their connection to you, and will learn to manage their feelings with time.<br/><br/> Separation anxiety can be tough, but reminding yourself that it won’t last forever can make a huge difference in how you respond to your child’s behaviour.

    subtitle: "Written by<b> Isobel Montgomery</b>,  Social Media Intern at Devie",
    date:"28 Apr, 2020",
    data:"<p class='paratext'>Did you know that your little one starts learning math skills from the time they are born? Even the littlest (and most boring!) things you do at home, from doing the dishes, to changing a nappy, can help your little one start developing early math skills. Curious about how this happens? We’ve put together some ways you can take advantage of these everyday moments- and help transform your toddler into a budding mathematician!",
    data2:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Getting dressed</b><br/><br/>There’s a big difference between your toddler knowing the names of numbers (one, two, three four) and the conceptual meaning of a number (one book, two eyes, three blocks). Toddlers will often know how to recite number names in sequence, before they start understanding what they mean. You help them learn what numbers represent, starting with the numbers 1 and 2!<br/><br/>One way little ones learn the concept of 1 and 2 is when they add “another one” to something they are holding — like another shoe, or another sock! ! By using the language of “another one” when getting dressed , you can help your little one understand the concept of 1 and 2. You might say “Here’s your sock, where’s the other one?” or “Have you put on your other shoe yet?”.<br/><br/>Another way to teach the concept of one and two is by counting body parts in the mirror! As you’re helping your little one get dressed, start by modeling the activity for your child. Look in the mirror and count your eyes, nose, ears and mouth out loud as you tap each one. You might say “I have one nose” or “I have one eye, two eyes!”. Then, encourage your child to do the same, and do it together!",
    data3:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Doing the laundry</b><br/><br/>Sorting and matching are important maths skills to introduce to young children. These skills help them focus on similarities and differences, which helps build their ability to think scientifically. One of the best ways to practice sorting is to involve your child in doing the laundry!<br/><br/>Try asking your little one to help with sorting the family laundry into colours. . You could say, “This top is black. Should we put it in the dark pile or the light pile?” After the laundry is done, have your little one help with matching pairs of socks and making piles for everyone in the family! Your little one will feel really special for being involved, and learn some early math in the process!",
    data4:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>In the Kitchen</b><br/><br/>You can teach your little one all kinds of math concepts by involving them in preparing a meal, and using lots of mathematical language! For example, you can start by reading a recipe together. Read it out loud, and then ask your little one, “So what’s the first step?” This helps your little one learn about sequences, and the concept of 1!<br/><br/>Next, you can collect the ingredients together. You might ask your child, “Can you get 2 courgettes from the fridge? And three tomatoes?”- counting in action!<br/><br/>As you make the recipe, talk to your little one about measurements and volume. For example, you could say, “we need one cup of water” or “we need to cut the tomato in half,” and involve your little one in measuring out and cutting ingredients (safely)! You can also talk about time. For example, “Okay, we need to stir this for five minutes- can you tell me when the clock turns to 5?”<br/><br/>Finally, ask your little one to help set the table for the number of people in the family- more counting!",
    data5:"<p class='paratext'>When you have little ones, everyday moments become special learning experiences! And these experiences help them understand and use math in everyday life- a great advantage when your little one starts school.

    subtitle: "Written by<b> Isobel Montgomery</b>,  Social Media Intern at Devie",
    date:"24 Apr, 2020",
    data:"<p class='paratext'>Crawling is a huge milestone for little ones and their parents, as it’s the start of many new adventures for your tot — and lots of baby proofing for parents! Babies start to crawl at different points in their development, taking anywhere from 6 to 12 months to start getting mobile. But there are lots of ways to encourage your little one to start exploring the world once they’re ready! The Devie team has put together some useful advice on how to get your little one up and about — check out our tips below!",
    data2:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Observe</b><br/><br/>It’s important not to rush your baby into crawling before they’re ready. However, there are lots of signs to look out for that show your little one is almost ready to start exploring! You might notice your baby has started dragging themselves around on their belly or rolling around. They might even start moving backwards- and get frustrated when they realise they’re moving away from the thing they’re trying to reach!<br/><br/>A key time to watch your child for signs of crawling is during tummy time. They might get on all fours and rock back and forth — just like a sprinter warming up! They might also push up and reach out with their arms, or kick their legs, because they’re eager to keep exploring! If they manage to get up onto all fours, try placing your palms just behind their feet to give them something to push off from and try crawling.",
    data3:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Motivate!</b><br/><br/>Once your little one is showing these signs, you can start motivating them to keep moving forward. An easy way to do this is by putting a few toys in front of your bub, slightly out of reach. This way, your little one will need to try and move to play with them.<br/><br/>It’s important to be patient, as it might take a few weeks for your little one to get going with crawling! You might also see them come up with more creative ways of getting to the toys, like rolling towards them! In all cases, it’s a good idea to give your baby time to try and get to their toys. But if you see them starting to get frustrated after a while, it’s a good idea to pause and give them a reassuring cuddle.",
    data4:"<p class='paratext'><b class='blog-context-title'>Demonstrate!</b><br/><br/>This step may make you feel a little silly, but it’s a great way to encourage your baby to start crawling! During tummy time, get onto the floor next to your child on all fours. Then, start crawling around with your little one. Your baby will find your actions very engaging and entertaining, and it might help them want to give crawling a try too. Plus, crawling around on the floor is a great way to get a baby’s eye view of your home — this will make future baby proofing much easier to do, as you’ll be able to spot any potential hazards!<br/><br/>If your little one takes awhile to get on the move, try not to stress. All babies reach this milestone at different rates. In the meantime, keep encouraging your baby during tummy time and see how it goes. A little encouragement goes a long way!",
