          <p class="blocktext">   By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to
      you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
      using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of
      the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
      extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to
      translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The
      app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
      intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Brewhackers

          <p class="blocktext">  Brewhackers Technologies Private Limited is committed to ensuring that the
      app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve
      the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
      time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its
      services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying
      for.</p>
          <p class="blocktext">  The Pondr app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to
      us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
      phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not
      jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software
      restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of
      your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
      malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security
      features and it could mean that the Pondr app won’t work properly or at
      all.</p>

          <p class="blocktext">  You should be aware that there are certain things that Brewhackers
      Technologies Private Limited will not take responsibility for. Certain
      functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet
      connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile
      network provider, but Brewhackers Technologies Private Limited cannot take
      responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t
      have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
          <p class="blocktext"> If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember
      that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will
      still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for
      the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
      app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
      responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you
      use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country)
      without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
      device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that
      you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
          <p class="blocktext">     Along the same lines, Brewhackers Technologies Private Limited cannot
      always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
      make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
      you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Brewhackers Technologies
      Private Limited cannot accept responsibility. </p>
          <p class="blocktext">  With respect to Brewhackers Technologies Private Limited’s responsibility
      for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear
      in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
      correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information
      to us so that we can make it available to you. Brewhackers Technologies
      Private Limited accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
      experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
      <p class="blocktext">
      At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
      available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for both systems(and for
      any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to)
      may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
      using the app. Brewhackers Technologies Private Limited does not promise
      that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or
      works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your
      device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application
      when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
      terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to
      you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights
      and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop
      using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
    </p>
    <p class="blocktext"><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
          <p class="blocktext">  We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are
      advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify
      you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>
